lang=EN-GB style='mso-ansi-language:EN-GB'>A structure for nucleic acid has already 
          been proposed by Paulingand Corey (1). They kindly made their manuscript 
          available to us in advanceof publication. Their model consists of three 
          intertwined chains, with thephosphates near the fibre axis, and the 
          bases on the outside. In our opinion,this structure is unsatisfactory 
          for two reasons: (1) We believe that thematerial which gives the X-ray 
          diagrams is the salt, not the free acid.Without the acidic hydrogen 
          atoms it is not clear what forces would holdthe structure together, 
          especially as the negatively charged phosphatesnear the axis will repel 
          each other. (2) Some of the van der Waals distancesappear to be too 
          small.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
        <p align="left"><span lang=EN-GB style='mso-ansi-language:EN-GB'>Another 
          three-chain structure has also been suggested by Fraser (in thepress). 
          In his model the phosphates are on the outside and the bases onthe inside, 
          linked together by hydrogen bonds. This structure as describedis rather 
          ill-defined, and for this reason we shall not comment on it.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
        <p align="left"><span lang=EN-GB style='mso-ansi-language:EN-GB'>We wish 
          to put forward a radically different structure for the salt ofdeoxyribose 
          nucleic acid. This structure has two helical chains each coiledround 
          the same axis (see diagram). We have made the usual chemical assumptions,namely, 
          that each chain consists of phosphate diester groups joining &szlig;-D-deoxyribofuranoseresidues 
          with 3',5' linkages. The two chains (but not their bases) are relatedby 
          a dyad perpendicular to the fibre axis. Both chains follow right- handedhelices, 
          but owing to the dyad the sequences of the atoms in the two chainsrun 
          in opposite directions. Each chain loosely resembles Furberg's2 modelNo. 
          1; that is, the bases are on the inside of the helix and the phosphateson 
          the outside. The configuration of the sugar and the atoms near it isclose 
          to Furberg's 'standard configuration', the sugar being roughly perpendicularto 
          the attached base. There is a residue on each every 3.4 A. in the z-direction.We 
          have assumed an angle of 36&deg; between adjacent residues in the samechain, 
          so that the structure repeats after 10 residues on each chain, thatis, 
          after 34 A. The distance of a phosphorus atom from the fibre axis is10 
          A. As the phosphates are on the outside, cations have easy access tothem.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
        <p align="left"><span lang=EN-GB style='mso-ansi-language:EN-GB'>The structure 
          is an open one, and its water content is rather high. Atlower water 
          contents we would expect the bases to tilt so that the structurecould 
          become more compact.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
        <p align="left"><span lang=EN-GB style='mso-ansi-language:EN-GB'>The novel 
          feature of the structure is the manner in which the two chainsare held 
          together by the purine and pyrimidine bases. The planes of thebases 
          are perpendicular to the fibre axis. The are joined together in pairs,a 
          single base from the other chain, so that the two lie side by side withidentical 
          z-co-ordinates. One of the pair must be a purine and the othera pyrimidine 
          for bonding to occur. The hydrogen bonds are made as follows: purine 
          position 1 to pyrimidine position 1 ; purine position 6 to pyrimidineposition 
          6.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
        <p align="left"><span lang=EN-GB style='mso-ansi-language:EN-GB'>If it 
          is assumed that the bases only occur in the structure in the mostplausible 
          tautomeric forms (that is, with the keto rather than the enolconfigurations) 
          it is found that only specific pairs of bases can bond together.These 
          pairs are : adenine (purine) with thymine (pyrimidine), and guanine(purine) 
          with cytosine (pyrimidine).<o:p></o:p></span></p>
        <p align="left"><span lang=EN-GB style='mso-ansi-language:EN-GB'>In other 
          words, if an adenine forms one member of a pair, on either chain,then 
          on these assumptions the other member must be thymine ; similarly forguanine 
          and cytosine. The sequence of bases on a single chain does not appearto 
          be restricted in any way. However, if only specific pairs of bases canbe 
          formed, it follows that if the sequence of bases on one chain is given,then 
          the sequence on the other chain is automatically determined.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
        <p align="left"><span lang=EN-GB style='mso-ansi-language:EN-GB'>It has 
          been found experimentally (3,4) that the ratio of the amountsof adenine 
          to thymine, and the ration of guanine to cytosine, are alwaysbery close 
          to unity for deoxyribose nucleic acid.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
        <p align="left"><span lang=EN-GB style='mso-ansi-language:EN-GB'>It is 
          probably impossible to build this structure with a ribose sugarin place 
          of the deoxyribose, as the extra oxygen atom would make too closea van 
          der Waals contact. The previously published X-ray data (5,6) on deoxyribosenucleic 
          acid are insufficient for a rigorous test of our structure. So faras 
          we can tell, it is roughly compatible with the experimental data, butit 
          must be regarded as unproved until it has been checked against more 
          exactresults. Some of these are given in the following communications. 
          We werenot aware of the details of the results presented there when 
          we devisedour structure, which rests mainly though not entirely on published 
          experimentaldata and stereochemical arguments.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
        <p align="left"><span lang=EN-GB style='mso-ansi-language:EN-GB'>It has 
          not escaped our notice that the specific pairing we have postulatedimmediately 
          suggests a possible copying mechanism for the genetic material.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
